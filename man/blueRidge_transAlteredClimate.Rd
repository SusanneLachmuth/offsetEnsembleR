\description{
A data set containing Gradient Forest transformed future climate normals (2071-2100)
for the Appalachian Blue Ridge Forest ecoregion at a resolution of 2.5 arcminutes.
The original climate variables were transformed using Gradient Forest turnover functions.
The Gradient Forest model was fit to data SNP candidate data for Southern Appalachian red spruce populations.
The transformations provide a common biological scale of compositional turnover (in this case, turnover in allele frequencies),
thereby allowing conversion from multidimensional climatic space to multidimensional genetic space
while selecting and weighting variables such that they best summarize genomic variation.
Please not that due to the transformation the variables are unitless.
